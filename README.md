## Usage

* Do all the maths!
* The `:`, `+`, `-`, `=` and all the number keys are mapped to the calculator as expected.
* The `esc` key is mapped to the `Clr` button.
* The `delete` / `backspace` key is mapped to the `Del` button.
* Pressing `enter` will trigger the `=` operation.
* Pressing `enter` after simply entring a number will convert that number into the correct time segments (try entering `1000000` then pressing enter).
